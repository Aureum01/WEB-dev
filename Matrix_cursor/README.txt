 Implement audio file input: Create a UI component to allow the user to input an audio file. This can be done using an HTML input element of type "file" and JavaScript code to handle the file selection.

    Perform sentiment analysis and emotional tone analysis: You'll need to use a suitable sentiment analysis and emotional tone analysis library or API to process the audio file's content. Depending on the chosen library or API, you may need to convert the audio file to text (using transcription) before performing the analysis.

    Retrieve emotional tone data: Extract the emotional tone or mood data from the sentiment analysis results. This could include identifying emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, or calmness.

    Visualize emotional tone: Modify the CSS properties of your application's background based on the emotional tone data. You can use JavaScript to dynamically update the CSS properties, such as background color, based on the emotional tone results.

    Display song information: Extract and display the song title or any other relevant metadata associated with the audio file. You can update an HTML element's content dynamically using JavaScript.
